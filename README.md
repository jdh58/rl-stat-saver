# RL Stat Saver

RLStatSaver is a simple stats saver for Rocket League.
It will track team color, username, goals, assists, saves, shots, demolitions, score, MMR, team score, Wins and Losses, timestamps, platform, and unique ID for each player.

## Set Up

- There is very little setup for this plugin. Simply install it and it should automatically track and save your match data.
- If you need help installing the plugin, go to [bakkesplugins.com](https://bakkesplugins.com/).

## How to Access Data

- At the end of each match, RLStatSaver will save each game's data to a .csv file in the bakkesmod data directory.
- The files are grouped by playlist and year.
- To find this directory, go to `%appdata%/bakkesmod/bakkesmod/data/RLStatSaver/{year}` and each `.csv` file will be named according to playlist.

## Use Cases & Other Info

The idea is this app will be acting as a local data repository for your Rocket League games.
It provides the flexibility to analyze trends, review past games for fun, and otherwise manipulate the file to your liking. No external services required.
